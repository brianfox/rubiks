-Snub cube- looks interesting.  It has 24 vertices corresponding
to the 24 possible 2x2 cube moves.  Oddly enough, the non-regular 
polygons are squares...

-8-cells- look interesting.  The path of operations on a 1x1 cube
made out of toothpicks looks like a strong potential for modeling.
Oddly, the path has 24 vertices again.  A magic number haunts the 
innards of the cube.

-Flatland- looks like an interesting read.

-Tesseract- looks like an interesting concept.

 Shifted interest towards graphing.  
 
 - Blender and Python - looks like it has potential for "pretty graphs" 
 with proper shading, lighting, and radiosity.  In reality, Blender
 chokes on graphs larger than level 7 or 8.
 
 - walrus and libsea - looks like this software has potential for 
 very large exponential graphs.  Libsea has zero source documentation
 however.  So the learning curve is steeper than it needs to be. 
 Walrus has some oddities with filling the entire graph boundaries
 and node positions.  But this might be a result of using very simple 
 graphs.
 
 - Java3d - looks like this has potential for stacked radial graphs.
 This might be interesting for comparing spatial, color mapped, 
 natural, and symmetrical cube storage techniques.
